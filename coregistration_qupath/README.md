# Co-registration in QuPath (Tutorial)


## Pre-requisites

- QuPath v0.4.x
- The Image Combiner Warpy extension v0.2.6

To install the Warpy extension in QuPath, download it from [here](https://github.com/BIOP/qupath-extension-warpy/releases/download/0.2.6/qupath-extension-warpy-0.2.6.zip) and drag and drop the extracted JAR-files from the archive onto the QuPath window. The QuPath documentation also recommends restarting QuPath after installing new extensions. If you have an older version of the extension installed since earlier, you can go to `Extensions->Installed extensions` in the menu in QuPath, select `Open extensions directory`, and remove the `qupath-extension-warpy-*.jar` file for the older version.  


## Using the Image Combiner Warpy extension

Start by creating a new project in QuPath, and add the images (OME-TIFF files) that should be co-registered to the project. In this example, we are going to use the DAPI channels from images of three different biomarkers (DNA, RNA, and protein) for the registration, to find the two transform matrices to align the RNA and protein biomarker images against the DNA biomarker images. Here is the single-channel `dna_dapi.ome.tif` that will be used as the reference DAPI image for the registration:

The Image Combiner Warpy extension uses the multiview feature of QuPath to provide control over the contrast and color (and also channel selection, for multi-channel images) of overlays shown during the registration. Additional views can be added via `Add row` and `Add column` under `Multi-view` in the menu whown when right-clicking on the image viewport:

Here we have added rows and columns for a grid of 2x2 views:

To open another image, click on a view to select it, and then double-click on the image in the `Image list` panel. Here we have opened the single-channel `rna_dapi.ome.tif` and the multi-channel `protein_cropped.ome.tif` in two of the additional views:

To adjust contrast and color, and select channel for multi-channel images, use the `Brightness & contrast` setting on each view. Here all images have been changed to grayscale, and the DAPI channel from the multi-channel `protein_cropped.ome.tif` image has been selected.

The Image Combiner Warpy tool should be available under `Analyze->Interactive image combiner warpy`. Before opening the tool, we need to select which image that should be reference for the registration, by clicking on its corresponding view so that it becomes active (indicated by a red outline around the view, and also by bold text in the `Image list` panel). The final co-registered image will have the same pixel size and resolution as the reference image. Here is what the tool looks like after opening it with `dna_dapi.ome.tif` selected:

After opening the tool, other images from the project can be added by clicking on `Choose images from project`. An image selected under the `Image & overlays` panel will display as an overlay on top of the reference image in the viewport. Here one of the other DAPI images, `rna_dapi.ome.tif`, has been selected:

After having found a good registration between the two DAPI images, we can transfer the transform matrix to other RNA biomarker images (`rna_a647.ome.tif` in this example), by simply copying the values in the text field `Current affine transform being displayed` from one image to another.

## Exporting the result to OME-TIFF

To export the co-registered result for processing or visualization in other software, select the view with the combined overlay generated by Image Combiner Warpy. Then go to `File->Export images->OME TIFF` and press `OK`. A message will be displayed after the export has fininshed (note that this can take a very long time, especially for large images with many channels!)

After the result has been exported, we can try to open the created OME-TIFF file in a new window of QuPath for inspection:
